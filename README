This projected was developed as a personal project and to be of use to me as a grade calculator for my courses.

iOS app in Swift:

*Multiple course selections, individual course grades, individual assignment grades and weights. Theme selector
**Current version is v1. Plans for v2 include GPA calculator, and calculating assignment group averages through each individual assignment. 
(Example: The HW group grade which consists of 10 assignments can be automatically calculated by totaling and averaging each homework assignment.)
